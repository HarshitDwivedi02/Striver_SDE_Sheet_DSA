# Striver_SDE_Sheet_DSA
I will be covering DSA problems from the Striver's SDE sheet and will be solving problems consistently.  


Rules: 
1. Cover all the day wise problems along with learning those topics. Plan accordingly
2. If any day problems covered early can create buffer by doing next day problems.
3. If failed to cover problems in a day (Penalty: No ice cream , Juice , UB anything for a week)
4. If cover early can celebrate by eating ice cream.
